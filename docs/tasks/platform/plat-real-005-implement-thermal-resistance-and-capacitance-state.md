## Metadata

| Field | Value |

| Status | Planned |
| Epic | [EPIC-REAL-001](../epics/epic-real-001.md) |
| Release | R4 |

| Effort | S |
| Depends on | PLAT-REAL-004 |

## Objective

Implement thermal resistance and capacitance state. Deliver one reviewable outcome that satisfies the named requirements without expanding into adjacent concerns.

## Context to read

- [docs/architecture/MULTI_FIDELITY_AND_CO_SIMULATION.md](../../architecture/MULTI_FIDELITY_AND_CO_SIMULATION.md)
- [Product requirements](../../PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md)
- [Test and validation strategy](../../quality/TEST_AND_VALIDATION_STRATEGY.md)
- [Relevant accepted ADRs](../../decisions/)

## Inputs

- The normative contracts, constraints, release budgets, and failure behavior in the linked documents.
- Existing prerequisite task evidence and any linked golden fixtures.

## Deliverables

- A complete implementation and evidence package for: **Implement thermal resistance and capacitance state**.
- Structured diagnostics for invalid, unsupported, cancelled, or resource-limited behavior where applicable.
- Updated tests, user/developer documentation, traceability, and release evidence owned by this concern.

## Allowed scope

- Only the contract, behavior, tests, and documentation directly necessary for this task title.

## Forbidden scope

- Do not redesign accepted public contracts, combine another independent concern, silently relax accuracy/security/accessibility budgets, or mark dependent tasks complete.

## Required behavior and edge cases

- Define nominal, boundary, invalid, failure, cancellation, and compatibility behavior relevant to the outcome.
- Preserve deterministic state and provenance where simulation or persisted data is involved.
- Keep simulation work off the browser main thread and untrusted execution inside the documented sandbox.

## Acceptance tests

1. The task's single outcome is observable and conforms to REQ-014, REQ-015, REQ-016 and the relevant architecture contract.
2. Nominal and at least one boundary/failure case produce the documented result or structured diagnostic.
3. Applicable golden, security, performance, browser, and accessibility evidence passes.
4. Requirement -> epic -> task -> test -> release traceability is updated with no unrelated scope change.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Deliverable and failure behavior match the normative documents.
- [ ] Acceptance evidence is reproducible and linked.
- [ ] No unrelated concern was implemented or silently deferred.
- [ ] Documentation, traceability, risks, and release evidence are current.
